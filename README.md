# Project Background
This project was undertaken as a portfolio piece to showcase my data analysis and dashboard creation skills using Microsoft Excel. 
I chose to analyze publicly available (or simulated) sales data from Ferns and Petals, a well-known online gifting company, to demonstrate the ability to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear, interactive format. 
The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance across various dimensions relevant to an e-commerce business.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales and revenue patterns by occasions, categories, cities and by timelines. Focusing on Revenue, Delivery time, and Average Customer Spents.
- **Product Level Performance:** An analysis of FNP's various products, understanding their potential demands in different months and occassions.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

FNP's database structure as seen below consists of three tables: orders, customers, and orders, with a total row count of 1000 order records.

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the datasets. 
The power query and DAX queries utilized to inspect, perform quality checks. Data cleaning, transformation and creation of calculated columns and calculated measures has also been done using DAX and power query.
